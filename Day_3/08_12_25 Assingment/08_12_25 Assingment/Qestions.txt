Q.1 Peak an element

An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.
Example 2:
Input: 
N = 2
arr[] = {3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 (at index 1) is the 
peak element as it is greater than 
its only neighbour element 3.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[] ≤ 106

Q.2
Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N having both negative and positive integers. The task is place all negative element at the end of array without changing the order of positive element and negative element.

Example 1:
Input : 
N = 8
arr[] = {1, -1, 3, 2, -7, -5, 11, 6 }
Output : 
1  3  2  11  6  -1  -7  -5

Example 2:
Input : 
N=8
arr[] = {-5, 7, -3, -4, 9, 10, -1, 11}
Output :
7  9  10  11  -5  -3  -4  -1

Q.3 Find the Union and Intersaction of two sorted array.
Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively. The task is to find union between these two arrays. 
Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in the union.
Example 1:
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
Output: 
5
Explanation: 
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the
elements which comes in the union set
of both arrays. So count is 5.
Example 2:
Input:
6 2 
85 25 1 32 54 6
85 2 
Output: 
7
Explanation: 
85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6, and
2 are the elements which comes in the
union set of both arrays. So count is 7.

Q.4
Write a program to cyclically rotate array by one.


QNO 5
Count pair with given sum.
Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to K.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4, K = 6
arr[] = {1,5,7,1}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
arr[0] + arr[1] = 1 + 5 = 6 
and arr[1] + arr[3] = 5 + 1 = 6.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 4, X = 2
arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 6
Explanation:
Each 1 will produce sum 2 with any 1.
